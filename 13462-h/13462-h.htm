<h2>NOTES.</h2>
<h3>THE MEANING OF "DRINK UP EISELL" IN HAMLET.</h3>
<p>Few passages have been more discussed than this wild challenge
of Hamlet to Laertes at the grave of Ophelia:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Ham. I lov'd Ophelia! forty thousand brothers</p>
<p>Could not, with all their quantity of love,</p>
<p>Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>&mdash;Zounds! show me what thou'lt do?</p>
<p>Woo't weep? Woo't fight? Woo't fast? Woo't tear</p>
<p>thyself?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Woo't drink up Eisell?</i> eat a crocodile?</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>I'll do't".</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The sum of what has been said may be given in the words of
Archdeacon Nares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is no doubt that eisell meant vinegar, nor even that
Shakspeare has used it in that sense; but in this passage it seems
that it must be put for the name of a Danish river.... The question
was much disputed between Messrs. Steevens and Malone: the former
being for the river, the latter for the vinegar; and he endeavored
even to get over the drink up, which stood much in his way. But
after all, the challenge to drink vinegar, in such a rant, is so
inconsistent, and even ridiculous, that we must decide for the
river, whether its name be exactly found or not. To drink up a
river, and eat a crocodile with his impenetrable scales, are two
things equally impossible. There is no kind of comparison between
the others."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I must confess that I was formerly led to adopt this view of the
passage, but on more mature investigation I find that it is wrong.
I see no necessary connection between eating a crocodile and
drinking up eysell; and to drink up was commonly used for simply to
drink. Eisell or Eysell certainly signified vinegar, but it was
certainly not used in that sense by Shakspeare, who may in this
instance be his own expositor; the word occurring again in his
CXIth sonnet.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink</p>
<p>Potions of eysell, 'gainst my strong infection;</p>
<p>No bitterness that I will bitter think,</p>
<p>Nor double penance, to correct correction."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here we see that it was a bitter potion which it was a penance
to drink. Thus also in the Troy Book of Lydgate:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Of bitter eysell, and of eager wine."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now numerous passages in our old dramatic writers show that it
was a fashion with the gallants of the time to do some extravagant
feat, as a proof of their love, in honour of their mistresses; and
among others the swallowing some nauseous potion was one of the
most frequent; but vinegar would hardly have been considered in
this light; wormwood might.</p>
<p>In Thomas's Italian Dictionary, 1562, we have "Assentio, Eysell"
and Florio renders that word by vinegar. What is meant, however, is
Absinthites or Wormwood wine, a nauseously bitter medicament then
much in use; and this being evidently <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>{242}</span> the
<i>bitter potion of Eysell</i> in the poet's sonnet, was certainly
the nauseous draught proposed to be taken by Hamlet among the other
extravagant feats as tokens of love. The following extracts will
show that in the poet's age this nauseous bitter potion was in
frequent use medicinally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ABSINTHIUM, [Greek: apsinthion, aspinthion], Comicis, ab
insigni amarore quo bibeates illud aversantur."-<i>Junius,
Nomenclator ap. Nicot</i>.</p>
<p>"ABSINTHITES, <i>wormwood wine</i>.&mdash;<i>Hutton's
Dict</i>.</p>
<p>"Hujus modi autem propomatum <i>hodie</i> apud Christianos
quoque <i>maximus est et frequentissimus usus</i>, quibus potatores
maximi ceu proemiis quibusdam atque pr&aelig;ludiis utuntur, ad
dirum illud suum propinandi certamen. <i>Ae maxime quidem commune
est proponia absynthites</i>, quod vim habet stomachum corroborandi
et extenuandi, expellendique excrementa qu&aelig; in eo
continentur. Hoc fere propomate potatores hodie maxime ab initio
coen&aelig; utuntur ceu pharmaco cum hestern&aelig;, atque
pr&aelig;terit&aelig;, tum futur&aelig; ebrietatis, atque
crapul&aelig;.... <i>amarissim&aelig; sunt potiones
medicat&aelig;</i>, quibus tandem stomachi cruditates immoderato
cibo potuque collectas expurgundi cause uti
coguntur."&mdash;Stuckius, <i>Antiquitat&aelig; Corviralium.
Tiguri</i>, 1582, fol. 327.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the two latest editors, Mr. Knight decides for the
<i>river</i>, and Mr. Collier does not decide at all. Our northern
neighbours think us almost as much deficient in philological
illustration as in enlarged philosophical criticism on the poet, in
which they claim to have shown us the way.</p>

<h3>AUTHORS OF THE ROLLIAD.</h3>
<p>To the list of subjects and authors in this unrivalled volume,
communicated by LORD BRAYBROOKE (Vol. ii., p. 194.), I would add
that No. XXI. <i>Probationary Odes</i> (which is unmarked in the
Sunning-hill Park copy) was written by Dr. Laurence: so also were
Nos. XIII. and XIV., of which LORD BRAYBROOKE speaks doubtfully. My
authority is the note in the correspondence of Burke and Laurence
published in 1827, page 21. The other names all agree with my own
copy, marked by the late Mr. A. Chalmers.</p>
<p>In order to render the account of the work complete, I would add
the following list of writers of the <i>Political Miscellanies</i>.
Those marked with an asterisk are said "not to be from the
club:"&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* Probationary Ode Extraordinary, by Mason.</p>
<p>The Statesmen, an Eclogue. Read.</p>
<p>Rondeau to the Right Honourable W. Eden. Dr. Laurence.</p>
<p>Epigrams from the Club. Miscellaneous.</p>
<p>The Delavaliad. Dr. Laurence.</p>
<p>This is the House that George built. Richardson.</p>
<p>Epigrams by Sir Cecil Wray. Tickell and Richardson.</p>
<p>Lord Graham's Diary, not marked.</p>
<p>* Extracts from 2nd Vol. of Lord Mulgrave's Essays.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Some of these minor contributions were from the pen of O'Beirne,
afterwards Bishop of Meath.</p>
<p>Tickell should be joined with Lord John Townshend in "Jekyll."
The former contributed the lines parodied from Pope.</p>
<p>In reply to LORD BRAYBROOKE'S Query, Moore, in his <i>Life of
Sheridan</i>, speaks of Lord John Townshend as the only survivor of
"this confederacy of wits:" so that, if he is correct, the author
of "Margaret Nicholson" (Adair) cannot be now living.</p>

<h3>NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>
<p>"There is nothing new under the sun," quoth the Preacher; and
such must be said of "NOTES AND QUERIES." Your contributor M. (Vol.
ii, p. 194.) has drawn attention to the <i>Weekly Oracle</i>, which
in 1736 gave forth its responses to the inquiring public; but, as
he intimates, many similar periodicals might be instanced. Thus, we
have <i>Memoirs for the Ingenious</i>, 1693, 4to., edited by I. de
la Crose; <i>Memoirs for the Curious</i>, 1701, 4to.; <i>The
Athenian Oracle</i>, 1704, 8vo.; <i>The Delphick Oracle</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id=
"page243"></a>{243}</span> 1720, 8vo.; <i>The British Apollo</i>,
1740, 12mo.; with several others of less note. The three last
quoted answer many singular questions in theology, law, medicine,
physics, natural history, popular superstitions, &amp;c., not
always very satisfactorily or very intelligently, but still, often
amusingly and ingeniously. <i>The British Apollo: containing two
thousand Answers to curious Questions in most Arts and Sciences,
serious, comical, and humourous</i>, the fourth edition of which I
have now before me, indulges in answering such questions as these:
"How old was Adam when Eve was created?&mdash;Is it lawful to eat
black pudding?&mdash;Whether the moon in Ireland is like the moon
in England? Where is hell situated? Do cocks lay eggs?" &amp;c. In
answer to the question, "Why is gaping catching?" the Querists of
1740 are gravely told,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Gaping or yawning is infectious, because the steams of the
blood being ejected out of the mouth, doth infect the ambient air,
which being received by the nostrils into another man's mouth, doth
irritate the fibres of the hypogastric muscle to open the mouth to
discharge by expiration the unfortunate gust of air infected with
the steams of blood, as aforesaid."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The feminine gender, we are further told, is attributed to a
ship, "because a ship carries burdens, and therefore resembles a
pregnant woman."</p>
<p>But as the faith of 1850 in <i>The British Apollo</i>, with its
two thousand answers, may not be equal to the faith of 1740, what
dependence are we to place in the origin it attributes to two very
common words, a <i>bull</i>, and a <i>dun</i>?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Why, when people speak improperly, is it termed a
bull?&mdash;It became a proverb from the repeated blunders of one
<i>Obadiah Bull</i>, a lawyer of London, who lived in the reign of
King Henry VII."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now for the second,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pray tell me whence you can derive the original of the word
<i>dun</i>? Some falsely think it comes from the French, where
<i>donnez</i> signifies <i>give me</i>, implying a demand of
something due; but the true original of this expression owes its
birth to one <i>Joe Dun</i>, a famous bailiff of the town of
Lincoln, so extremely active, and so dexterous at the management of
his rough business, that it became a proverb, when a man refused to
pay his debts, 'Why don't you <i>Dun</i> him?' that is, why don't
you send Dun to arrest him? Hence it grew a custom, and is now as
old as since the days of Henry VII."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Were these twin worthies, Obadiah Bull the lawyer, and Joe Dun
the bailiff, men of straw for the nonce, or veritable flesh and
blood? They both flourished, it appears, in the reign of Henry
VII.; and to me it is doubtful whether one reign could have
produced two worthies capable of cutting so deep a notch in the
English tongue.</p>
<p>"To dine with Duke Humphrey," we are told, arose from the
practice of those who had shared his dainties when alive being in
the habit of perambulating St. Paul's, where he was buried, at the
dining time of day; what dinner they then had, they had with Duke
Humphrey the defunct.</p>
<p>Your contributor MR. CUNNINGHAM will be able to decide as to the
value of the origin of Tyburn here given to us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As to the antiquity of Tyburn, it is no older than the year
1529; before that time, the place of execution was in <i>Rotten
Row</i> in <i>Old Street</i>. As for the etymology of the word
<i>Tyburn</i>, some will have it proceed from the words <i>tye</i>
and <i>burn</i>, alluding to the manner of executing traitors at
that place; others believe it took its name from a small river or
brook once running near it, and called by the Romans Tyburnia.
Whether the first or second is the truest, the querist may judge as
he thinks fit."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so say I.</p>
<p>A readable volume might be compiled from these "NOTES AND
QUERIES," which amused our grandfathers; and the works I have
indicated will afford much curious matter in etymology, folk-lore,
topography, &amp;c., to the modern antiquary.</p>

<h3>JAMES THE SECOND, HIS REMAINS.</h3>
<p>The following curious account was given to me by Mr.
Fitz-Simons, an Irish gentleman, upwards of eighty years of age,
with whom I became acquainted when resident with my family at
Toulouse, in September, 1840; he having resided in that city for
many years as a teacher of the French and English languages, and
had attended the late Sir William Follett in the former capacity
there in 1817. He said,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was a prisoner in Paris, in the convent of the English
Benedictines in the Rue St. Jaques, during part of the revolution.
In the year 1793 or 1794, the body of King James II. of England was
in one of the chapels there, where it had been deposited some time,
under the expectation that it would one day be sent to England for
interment in Westminster Abbey. It had never been buried. The body
was in a wooden coffin, inclosed in a leaden one; and that again
inclosed in a second wooden one, covered with black velvet. That
while I was so a prisoner, the sans-culottes broke open the coffins
to get at the lead to cast into bullets. The body lay exposed
nearly a whole day. It was swaddled like a mummy, bound tight with
garters. The sans-culottes took out the body, which had been
embalmed. There was a strong smell of vinegar and camphor. The
corpse was beautiful and perfect. The hands and nails were very
fine, I moved and bent every finger. I never saw so fine a set of
teeth in my life. A young lady, a fellow prisoner, wished much to
have a tooth; I tried to get one out for her, but could not, they
were so firmly fixed. The feet also were very beautiful. The face
and cheeks were just as if he were alive. I rolled his eyes: the
eye-balls were perfectly firm under my finger. The French and
English prisoners <span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id=
"page244"></a>{244}</span> gave money to the sans-culottes for
showing the body. They said he was a good sans-culotte, and they
were going to put him into a hole in the public churchyard like
other sand-culottes; and he was carried away, but where the body
was thrown I never heard. King George IV. tried all in his power to
get tidings of the body, but could not. Around the chapel were
several wax moulds of the face hung up, made probably at the time
of the king's death, and the corpse was very like them. The body
had been originally kept at the palace of St. Germain, from whence
it was brought to the convent of the Benedictines. Mr. Porter, the
prior, was a prisoner at the time in his own convent."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above I took down from Mr. Fitz-Simons' own mouth, and read
it to him, and he said it was perfectly correct. Sir W. Follett
told me he thought Mr. Fitz-Simons was a runaway Vinegar Hill boy.
He told me that he was a monk.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>
<p><i>The Legend of Sir Richard Baker</i> (vol. ii., p.
67.).&mdash;Will F.L. copy the inscription on the monument in
Cranbrook Church? The dates on it will test the veracity of the
legend. In the reign of Queen Mary, the representative of the
family was Sir John Baker, who in that, and the previous reigns of
Edward VI. and Henry VIII., had held some of the highest offices in
the kingdom. He had been Recorder of London, Speaker of the House
of Commons, Attorney-General and Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
died in the first year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. His son,
Sir Richard Baker, was twice high-sheriff of the county of Kent,
and had the honour of entertaining Queen Elizabeth in her progress
through the county. This was, most likely, the person whose
monument F.L. saw in Cranbrook Church. The family had been settled
there from the time of Edward III., and seem to have been adding
continually to their possessions; and at the time mentioned by F.L.
as that of their decline, namely, in the reign of Edward VI., they
were in reality increasing in wealth and dignities. If the Sir
Richard Baker whose monument is referred to by F.L. was the son of
the Sir John above mentioned, the circumstances of his life
disprove the legend. He was not the sole representative of the
family remaining at the accession of Queen Mary. His father was
then living, and at the death of his father his brother John
divided with him the representation of the family, and had many
descendants. The family estates were not dissipated; on the
contrary, they were handed down through successive generations, to
one of whom, a grandson of Sir Richard, the dignity of a baronet
was given; and Sivinghurst, which was the family seat, was in the
possession of the third and last baronet's grandson, E.S. Beagham,
in the year 1730. Add to this that the Sir Richard Baker in
question was twice married, and that a monumental erection of the
costly and honourable description mentioned by F.L. was allowed to
be placed to his memory in the chancel of the church of the parish
in which such Bluebeard atrocities are said to have been committed,
and abundant grounds will thence appear for rejecting the truth of
the legend in the absence of all evidence. The unfortunately red
colour of the gloves most likely gave rise to the story. Nor is
this a solitary instance of such a legend having such an origin. In
the beautiful parish church of Aston, in Warwickshire, are many
memorials of the Baronet family of Holt, who owned the adjoining
domain and hall, the latter of which still remains, a magnificent
specimen of Elizabethan architecture. Either in one of the
compartments of a painted window of the church, or upon a
monumental marble to one of the Holts, is the Ulster badge, as
showing the rank of the deceased, and painted red. From the colour
of the badge, a legend of the bloody hand has been created as
marvellous as that of the Bloody Baker, so fully detailed by
F.L.</p>

<p><i>Langley, Kent, Prophetic Spring at.</i>&mdash;The following
"note" upon a passage in <i>Warkworth's Chronicle</i> (pp. 23, 24.)
may perhaps possess sufficient interest to warrant its insertion in
your valuable little publication. The passage is curious, not only
as showing the superstitious dread with which a simple natural
phenomenon was regarded by educated and intelligent men four
centuries ago, but also as affording evidence of the accurate
observation of a writer, whose labours have shed considerable light
upon "one of the darkest periods in our annals." The chronicler is
recording the occurrence, in the thirteenth year of Edward the
Fourth, of a "gret hote somere," which caused much mortality, and
"unyversalle fevers, axes, and the blody flyx in dyverse places of
Englonde," and also occasioned great dearth and famine "in the
southe partyes of the worlde."</p>
<p>He then remarks that "dyverse tokenes have be schewede in
Englonde this year for amendynge of mannys lyvynge," and proceeds
to enumerate several springs or waters in various places, which
only ran at intervals, and by their running always portended
"derthe, pestylence, or grete batayle." After mentioning several of
these, he adds&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Also ther is a pytte in Kent in Langley Parke: ayens any
batayle he wille be drye, and it rayne neveyre so myche; and if
ther be no batayle toward, he wille be fulle of watere, be it
neveyre so drye a wethyre; and this yere he is drye."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Langley Park, situated in a parish of the same <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>{245}</span> name,
about four miles to the south-east of Maidstone, and once the
residence of the Leybournes and other families, well-known in
Kentish history, has long existed only in name, having been
disparked prior to 1570; but the "pytte," or stream, whose wondrous
qualities are so quaintly described by Warkworth, still flows at
intervals. It is scarcely necessary to add, that it belongs to the
class known as <i>intermitting springs</i>, the phenomena displayed
by which are easily explained by the syphon-like construction of
the natural reservoirs whence they are supplied.</p>
<p>I have never heard that any remnant of this curious superstition
can now be traced in the neighbourhood, but persons long acquainted
with the spot have told me that the state of the stream was
formerly looked upon as a good index of the probable future price
of corn. The same causes, which regulated the supply or deficiency
of water, would doubtless also affect the fertility of the
soil.</p>

of your useful and agreeable periodical, in what collection of
nursery rhymes a poem called, I think, "The Spider and Fly,"
occurs, and if procurable, where? The lines I allude to consisted,
to the best of my recollection, of a dialogue between a fly and a
spider, and began thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>There were other stanzas, I believe, but these are all I can

collection of nursery songs and rhymes by Charles Lamb, published
many years ago, but now quite out of print. This, however, is a
mere surmise on my part, and has no better foundation than the vein
of humour, sprightliness, and originality, obvious enough in the

ancient title-pages, but so mixed with other matters as to render
the finding a desired symbol, unless very familiar, a work of great
difficulty. Could there be a systematic arrangement of all those
known, with their definitions, it would be a very valuable work of
reference,&mdash;a work in which one might pounce upon all the
sacred symbols, classic types, signs, heraldic zoology,
conventional botany, monograms, and the like abstract art.</p>

<p><i>Sitting during the Lessons.</i>&mdash;What is the origin of
the congregation remaining seated, while the first and second

the subject; it merely directs that the person who reads them shall
stand:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He that readeth so standing and turning himself, as he may best
be heard of all such as are present."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With respect to the practice of sitting while the epistle is
read, and of standing while the gospel is read, in the communion
service; there is in the rubric a distinct direction that "all the
people are to stand up" during the latter, while it is silent as to
the former. From the silence of the rubric as to standing during
the two lessons of the morning service, and the epistle in the
communion service, it seems to have been inferred that the people
were to sit. But why are they directed to stand during the gospel
in the communion service, while they sit during the second lesson
in the morning service?</p>

figures is of the latter half of the fifteenth century. The
painter's name appears on a scroll, OP. VICTOR CARPATIO VENETI. The
copy of the picture for engraving was drawn by Giovanni de Pian,
and engraved by the same person and Francesco Gallimberti, at
Venice. I do not find the name of Carpatio in the ordinary
dictionaries of painters, and shall be glad to learn whether he has
here represented an historical event, or an incident of some
medi&aelig;val romance. I suspect the latter must be the case, as
<i>Cornubia</i> is the Latin word used for Cornwall, and I am not

<p><i>Z&uuml;nd-nadel Guns.</i>&mdash;In paper of September or

<blockquote>
<p>"We have had this morning a splendid military spectacle, and
being the first of the kind since the revolution, attracted immense
crowds to the scene of action."</p>
<p>"The Fusileer battalions (light infantry) were all armed with
the new z&uuml;nd-nadel guns, the advantages and superiority of
which over the common percussion musket now admits of no
contradiction, with the sole exception of the facility of loading
being an inducement to fire somewhat too quick, when firing
independently, as in battle, or when acting en tirailleur. The
invincible pedantry and amour-propre of our armourers and
inspectors of arms in England, their disinclination to adopt
inventions not of English growth, and their slowness to avail
themselves of new models until they are no longer new, will,
undoubtedly, exercise the usual influence over giving this powerful
weapon even a chance in England. It is scarcely necessary to point
out the great advantages that these weapons, carrying, let us say,
800 yards with perfect accuracy, have over our muskets, of which
the range does not exceed 150, and that very uncertain. Another
great advantage of the z&uuml;nd-nadel is, that rifles or light
infantry can load with ease without effort when lying flat on the
ground. The opponents of the z&uuml;nd-nadel talk of over-rapid
firing and the impossibility of carrying sufficient ammunition to
supply the demands. This is certainly a drawback, but it is
compensated by the immense advantage of being able to pour in a
deadly fire when you yourself are out of range, or of continuing
this fire so speedily as to destroy half your opponents before they
can return a shot with a chance of taking effect."</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a very remarkable work, written in an admirable style,
and wholly free from the coarse party spirit which then generally
prevailed. The writer declares, p. 235., he had not subscribed the
engagement, and there are internal evidences of his being a
churchman and a monarchist. Is there any proof of its having been
written by Sir Robert Howard? A former possessor of the copy now
before me, has written his name on the title-page as its
conjectured author. My copy of Sir Robert's <i>Poems</i>, published
two years after, was published not by <i>Fletcher</i>, but by
"Henry Herringman, at the sign of the Anchor, in the lower walk of

Prince of Wales, and so on, to the present time?</p>
<p><i>Miniature Gibbet, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;A correspondent of the
<i>Times</i> newspaper has recently given the following account of
an occurrence which took place about twenty-five years ago, and the
concluding ceremony of which he personally witnessed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A man had been condemned to be hung for murder. On the Sunday
morning previous to the sentence being carried into execution, he
contrived to commit suicide in the prison by cutting his throat
with a razor. On Monday morning, according to the then custom, his
body was brought out from Newgate in a cart; and after Jack Ketch
had exhibited to the people a small model gallows, with a razor
hanging therefrom, in the presence of the sheriffs and city
authorities, he was thrown into a hole dug for that purpose. A
stake was driven through his body, and a quantity of lime thrown in
over it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will any correspondent of "NOTES AND QUERIES" give a solution of
this extraordinary exhibition? Had the sheriffs and city
authorities any legal sanction for Jack Ketch's disgusting part in
the performances? What are the meaning and origin of driving a
stake through the body of a suicide?</p>

<h2>REPLIES</h2>
<h3>COLLAR OF SS.</h3>
<p>If you desire proof of the great utility of your publication,
methinks there is a goodly quantum of it in the very interesting
and valuable information on the Collar of SS., which the short
simple question of B. (Vol. ii., p. 89.) has drawn forth; all
tending to illustrate a mooted historical question:&mdash;first, in
the reply of [Greek: Phi.] (Vol. ii., p. 110.), giving reference to
the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, with two <i>rider</i>-Queries;
then MR. NICHOLS'S announcement (Vol. ii., p. 140.) of a
forthcoming volume on the subject, and a reply in part to the Query
of [Greek: Phi.]; then (Vol. ii, p. 171.) MR. E. FOSS, as to the
<i>rank</i> of the legal worthies allowed to wear this badge of
honour; and next (Vol. ii., p. 194.) an ARMIGER, who, though he
rides rather high on the subject, over all the Querists and
Replyists, deserves many thanks for his very instructive and
scholarlike dissertation.</p>
<p>What the S. signifies has evidently been a puzzle. That a chain
is a badge of honour, there can be no doubt; but may not the
<i>Esses</i>, after all, mean nothing at all? originating in the
simple S. link, a form often used in chain-work, and under the name
of S. A series of such, linked together, would produce an elegant
design, which in the course of years would be wrought more like the
letter, and be embellished and varied according to the skill and
taste of the workman, and so, that which at first had no particular
meaning, and was merely accidental, would, after a time, be
<i>supposed</i> to be the <i>initial letters</i> of what is now
only guessed at, or be involved in heraldic mystery. As for [Greek:
Phi.]'s rider-Query (Vol ii., p. 110.), repeated by MR. FOSS (Vol.
ii., p. 171.), as to dates,&mdash;it may be one step towards a
reply if I here mention, that in Yatton Church, Somerset, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id=
"page249"></a>{249}</span> is a beautifully wrought alabaster
monument, without inscription, but traditionally ascribed to judge
Newton, alias Cradock, and his wife Emma de Wyke. There can be no
doubt, from the costume, that the effigy is that of a judge, and
under his robes is visible the Collar of Esses. The monument is in
what is called the Wyke aisle or chapel. That it is Cradock's, is
confirmed by a garb or wheat-sheaf, on which his head is laid. (The
arms of Cradock are, Arg. on a chevron az. 3 <i>garbs</i> or.)
Besides, in the very interesting accounts of the churchwardens of
the parish, annis 1450-1, among the receipts there is this
entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It.: Recipim. de Dn&agrave; de Wyke p. man. T. Newton filii sui
de legato Dni. Riei. Newton ad &mdash;&mdash; p. campana ...
xx."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Cradock was the first of his family who took the name of
Newton, and I have been informed that the last fine levied before
him was, Oct. Mart. 27 Hen. VI. (Nov. 1448), proving that the
canopied altar tomb in Bristol Cathedral, assigned to him, and
recording that he died 1444, must be an error. It is stated, that
the latter monument was defaced during the civil wars, and repaired
in 1747, which is, probably, all that is true of it. But this would
carry me into another subject, to which, perhaps, I may be allowed
to return some other day. However, we have got a date for the use
of the collar by the <i>chief</i> judges, <i>earlier</i> than that
assigned by MR. FOSS, and it is somewhat confirmatory of what he
tells us, that it was not worn by any of the <i>puisne</i>
order.</p>

<hr />
<p><i>The Livery Collar of SS.</i>&mdash;Though ARMIGER (Vol. ii.,
p. 194.) has not adduced any facts on this subject that were
previously unknown to me, he has advanced some misstatements and
advocated some erroneous notions, which it may be desirable at once
to oppose and contradict; inasmuch as they are calculated to
envelope in fresh obscurity certain particulars, which it was the
object of my former researches to set forth in their true light.
And first, I beg to say that with respect to the "four
inaccuracies" with which he charges me, I do not plead guilty to
any of them. 1st. When B. asked the question, "Is there any list of
persons who were honoured with that badge?" it was evident that he
meant, Is there any list of the names of such persons, as of the
Knights of the Garter or the Bath? and I correctly answered, No:
for there still is no such list. The description of the classes of
persons who might use the collar in the 2 Hen. IV. is not such a
list as B. asked for. 2dly. Where I said "That persons were not
honoured with the badge, in the sense that persons are now
decorated with stars, crosses, or medals," I am again unrefuted by
the statute of 2 Hen. IV., and fully supported by many historical
facts. I repeat that the livery collar was not worn as a badge of
honour, but as a badge of feudal allegiance. It seems to have been
regarded as giving certain weight and authority to the wearer, and,
therefore, was only to be worn in the king's presence, or in coming
to and from the king's hostel, except by the higher ranks; and this
entirely confirms my view. Had it been a mere personal decoration,
like the collar of an order of knighthood, there would have been no
reason for such prohibition; but as it conveyed the impression that
the wearer was especially one of the king's immediate military or
household servants, and invested with certain power or influence on
that ground, therefore its assumption away from the neighbourhood
of the court was prohibited, except to individuals otherwise well
known from their personal rank and station. 3dly. When ARMIGER
declares I am wrong in saying "That the collar was <i>assumed</i>,"
I have every reason to believe I am still right. I may admit that,
if it was literally a livery, it would be worn only by those to
whom the king gave it; but my present impression is, that it was
termed the king's livery, as being of the pattern which was
originally distributed by the king, or by the Duke of Lancaster his
father, to his immediate adherents, but which was afterwards
<i>assumed</i> by all who were anxious to assert their loyalty, or
distinguish their partizanship as true Lancastrians; so that the
statute of 2 Hen. IV. was rendered necessary to restrain its undue
and extravagant <i>assumption</i>, for sundry good political
reasons, some notion of which may be gathered by perusing the poem
on the deposition of Richard II. published by the Camden Society.
And 4thly, Where ARMIGER disputes my conclusion, that the assumers
were, so far as can be ascertained, those who were attached to the
royal household or service, it will be perceived, by what I have
already stated, that I still adhere to that conclusion. I do not,
therefore, admit that the statute of 2 Henry IV. shows me to be
incorrect in any one of those four particulars. ARMIGER next
proceeds to allude to Manlius Torquatus, who won and wore the
golden torc of a vanquished Gaul: but this story only goes to prove
that the collar of the Roman <i>torquati</i> originated in a
totally different way from the Lancastrian collar of livery.
ARMIGER goes on to enumerate the several derivations of the Collar
of Esses&mdash;from the initial letter of <i>Soverayne</i>, from
<i>St. Simplicius</i>, from <i>St. Crispin</i> and <i>St.
Crispinian</i>, the martyrs of Soissons, from the <i>Countess of
Salisbury</i>, from the word <i>Souvenez</i>, and lastly, from the
office of <i>Seneschalus</i>, or Steward of England, held by John
of Ghent,&mdash;which is, as he says, "Mr. Nichols's notion," but
the whole of which he stigmatises alike "as mere monkish or
heraldic gossip;" and, finally, he proceeds to unfold his own
recondite discovery, "viz. that it comes from the S-shaped lever
upon the bit <span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id=
"page250"></a>{250}</span> of the bridle of the war steed,"&mdash;a
conjecture which will assuredly have fewer adherents than any one
of its predecessors. But now comes forth the disclosure of what
school of heraldry this ARMIGER is the champion. He is one who can
tell us of "many more rights and privileges than are dreamt of in
the philosophy either of the court of St. James's or the college of
St. Bennet's Hill!" In short, he is the mouthpiece of "the
Baronets' Committee for Privileges." And this is the law which he
lays down:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The persons now privileged to wear the ancient golden collar of
SS. are the <i>equites aurati</i>, or knights (chevaliers) in the
British monarchy, a body which includes all the hereditary order of
baronets in England, Scotland, and Ireland, with such of their
eldest sons, being of age, as choose to claim inauguration as
knights."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have a full confession of a large part of the faith of
the Baronets' Committee,&mdash;a committee of which the greater
number of those who lent their names to it are probably by this
time heartily ashamed. It is the doctrine held forth in several
works on the Baronetage compiled by a person calling himself "Sir
Richard Broun," of whom we read in Dodd's <i>Baronetage</i>, that
"previous to succeeding his father, he demanded inauguration as a
knight, in the capacity of a baronet's eldest son; but the Lord
Chamberlain having refused to present him to the Queen for that
purpose, he assumed the title of 'Sir,' and the addition of 'Eques
Auratus,' in June, 1842." So we see that ARMIGER and the Lord
Chamberlain are at variance as to part of the law above cited; and
so, it might be added, have been other legal authorities, to the
privileges asserted by the mouthpiece of the said committee. But
that is a long story, on which I do not intend here to enter. I had
not forgotten that in one of the publications of Sir Richard Broun
the armorial coat of the premier baronet of each division is
represented encircled with a Collar of Esses; but I should never
have thought of alluding to this freak, except as an amusing
instance of fantastic assumption. I will now confine myself to what
has appeared in the pages of "NOTES AND QUERIES;" and, more
particularly, to the unfounded assertion of ARMIGER in p. 194.,
"that the golden Collar of SS. was the undoubted badge or mark of a
knight, <i>eques auratus</i>;" which he follows up by the dictum
already quoted, that "the persons now privileged to wear the
ancient golden Collar of SS. are the <i>equites aurati</i>." I
believe it is generally admitted that knights were <i>equites
aurati</i> because they wore golden or gilt spurs; certainly it was
not because they wore golden collars, as ARMIGER seems to wish us
to believe; and the best proof that the Collar of Esses was not the
badge of a knight, as such, at the time when such collars were most
worn, in the fifteenth century, is this&mdash;that the monumental
effigies and sepulchral brasses of many knights at that time are
still extant which have no Collar of Esses; whilst the Collar of
Esses appears only on the figures of a limited number, who were
undoubtedly such as wished to profess their especial adherence to
the royal House of Lancaster.</p>

<h3>SIR GREGORY HORTON, BART.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 216.)</h4>
<p>The creation of the baronetcy of <i>Norton</i>, of Rotherfield,
in East Tysted, co. Hants, took place in the person of Sir Richard
Norton, of Rotherfield, Kt., 23d May, 1622, and <i>expired</i> with
him on his death without male issue in 1652.</p>
<p>The style of Baronet, in the case of <i>Sir Gregory Norton</i>,
the <i>regicide</i>, was an assumption not uncommon in those days;
as in the case of <i>Prettyman</i> of Lodington, and others.</p>
<p>The regicide in his will styles himself "Sir Richard Norton, of
Paul's, Covent Garden, in the county of Middlesex, Bart." It bears
date 12th March, 1651, and was proved by his relict, Dame Martha
Norton, 24th Sept., 1652. He states that his land at Penn, in the
county of Bucks, was <i>mortgaged</i>, and mentions his
"disobedient son, Henrie Norton;" and desires his burial-place may
be at Richmond, co. Surrey.</p>
<p>The descent of Gregory Norton is not known. There is no evidence
of his connexion with the Rotherfield or Southwick Nortons. His
assumption of the title was not under any claim he could have had,
real or imaginary, connected with the Rotherfield patent; for he
uses the title at the same time with Sir Richard of Rotherfield,
whose will is dated 26th July, 1652, and not proved till 5th Oct,
1652, when Sir Gregory was dead; and, what is singular, the will of
Sir Richard was proved by his brother, John Norton, by the style of
<i>Baronet</i>, to which he could have had no pretension, as Sir
Richard died without male issue, and there was no limitation of the
patent of 1622 on failure of heirs male of the body of the
grantee.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE'S WORD "DELIGHTED."</h3>
<p>That the Shakspearian word <i>delighted</i> might, as far as its
form goes, mean "endowed with delight," "full of delight," I should
readily concede; but this meaning would suit neither the passage in
<i>Measure for Measure</i>,&mdash;"the delighted spirit,"&mdash;nor
(satisfactorily) that in <i>Othello</i>,&mdash;"delighted beauty."
Whether, therefore, <i>delighted</i> be derived from the Latin
<i>delectus</i> or not, I still believe that it means "refined,"
"dainty," "delicate;" a sense which is curiously adapted to each of
the three places. This will not be questioned with respect to the
second and third passages cited by <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page251" id="page251"></a>{251}</span> MR. HICKSON: and the
following citations will, I think, prove the point as effectually
for the passage of <i>Measure for Measure</i>:</p>

<p class="i4">sc. 1.</p>

<p>I do not know the precise nature of the "old authorities" which
MR. SINGER opposes to my conjecture: but may we not demur to the
conclusiveness of any "old authorities" on such a point? Etymology
seems to be one of the developing sciences, in which we know more,
and better, than our forefathers, as our descendants will know
more, and better, than we do.</p>
<p>To end with a brace of queries. Are not <i>delicioe</i>,
<i>delicatus</i>, more probably from <i>deligere</i> than from
<i>delicere</i>? And whence comes the word <i>dainty</i>? I cannot
believe in the derivation from <i>dens</i>, "a tooth."</p>

<h3>A&Euml;ROSTATION.</h3>
<p>Your correspondent C.B.M. (Vol. ii., p 199.) will find a long
article on <i>A&euml;rostation</i> in Rees'
<i>Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>; but his inquiry reminds me of a
conversation I had with the late Sir Anthony Carlisle, about a year
before his death. He wished to consult me on the subject of flying
by mechanical means, and that I should assist him in some of his
arrangements. He had devoted many years of his life to the
consideration of this subject, and made numerous experiments at
great cost, which induced him to believe in the possibility of
enabling man to fly by means of artificial wings. However visionary
this idea might be, he had collected innumerable and extremely
interesting data, having examined the anatomical structure of
almost every winged thing in the creation, and compared the weight
of the body with the area of the wings when expanded in the act of
volitation as well as the natural habits of birds, insects, bats,
and fishes, with reference to their powers of flying and duration
of flight.</p>
<p>These notes would form a valuable addition to natural history,
whatever might be thought of the purpose for which they were
collected, during a period of thirty years; and it is much to be
regretted they were never published. His own opinion was, that the
publication, during his life would injure his practice as a
physician. It would be impossible without the aid of diagrams, and
I do not remember sufficient, to explain his mechanical
contrivances; but the general principle was, to suspend the man
under a kind of flat parachute of extremely thin
<i>feather-edge</i> boards, with a power of adjusting the angle at
which it was placed, and allowing the man the full use of his arms
and legs to work any machinery placed beneath; the area of the
parachute being proportioned, as in birds to the weight of the man,
who was to start from the top of a high tower, or some elevated
position, flying against the wind.</p>

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>Long Lonkin</i> (Vol. ii., p. 168.).&mdash;If SELEUCUS will
refer to Mr. Chamber's <i>Collection of Scottish Ballads</i>, he
will find there the whole story under the name of Lammilsin, of
which Lonkin appears to me to be a corruption. In the 6th verse it
is rendered:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"He said to his ladye fair,</p>
<p>Before he gaed abuird,</p>
<p>Beware, beware o, Lammilsin!</p>
<p>For he lyeth in the wudde."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then the story goes on to state that Lammilsin crept in at a
little shot window, and after some conversation with the "fause
nourrice" they decide to</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Stab the babe, and make it cry,</p>
<p>And that will bring her down."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Which being done, they murder the unhappy lady. Shortly after,
Lord Weirie comes home, and has the "fause nourrice" burnt at the
stake. From the circumstance that the name of the husband of the
murdered lady was Weirie, it is conjectured that this tragedy took
place at Balwearie Castle, in Fife, and the old people about there
constantly affirm that it really occurred. I am not aware that
there exists any connection between the hero of this story and the
<i>nursery rhyme</i>; for, as I before stated, I think Lonkin a
corruption of Lammilsin.</p>

<p><i>Guy's Armour</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 55. 187.).&mdash;With respect
to the armour said to have belonged to Guy, Earl of Warwick, your
correspondent NASO is referred to Grose's <i>Military
Antiquities</i>, vol. ii. pl. 42., where he will find an engraving
of a bascinet of the fourteenth century, much dilapidated, but
having still a fragment of the moveable vizor adhering to the pivot
on which it worked. Whether this interesting relic is still at
Warwick Castle or not, I cannot pretend to say, as I was
unfortunately prevented joining the British Arch&aelig;ological
Association at the Warwick congress in 1847, and have never visited
that part of the country; but the bascinet which was there in
Grose's time was at least of the date of Guido de Beauchamp, Earl
of Warwick, the builder of Guy's Tower, who died in 1315, and who
has always been confounded with the fabulous Guy: and if it has
disappeared, we have to regret the loss of the only specimen of an
English bascinet of that period that I am aware of in this
country.</p>
<p class="author">J.R. PLANCH&Ecirc;</p>
<p><i>Alarm</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 151. 183.).&mdash;The origin of this
word appears to be the Italian cry, <i>all'arme; gridare
all'arme</i> is to give the alarm. Hence the French <i>alarme</i>,
and from the French is borrowed the English word. <i>Alarum</i> for
<i>alarm</i>, is merely a corruption produced by mispronunciation.
The letters <i>l</i> and <i>r</i> before <i>m</i> are difficult to
pronounce; and they are in general, according to the refined
standard of our pronunciation, so far softened as only to lengthen
the preceding vowel. In provincial pronunciation, however, the
force of the former letter is often preserved, and the
pronunciation is facilitated by the insertion of a vowel before the
final <i>m</i>. The Irish, in particular, adopt this mode of
pronouncing; even in public speaking they say <i>callum</i>,
<i>firrum</i>, <i>farrum</i>, for <i>calm</i>, <i>firm</i>,
<i>farm</i>. The old word <i>chrisom</i> for <i>chrism</i>, is an
analogous change: the Italians have in like manner lengthened
<i>chrisma</i> into <i>cresima</i>; the French have softened it
into <i>chr&ecirc;me</i>.</p>
<p class="author">L.</p>
<p><i>Alarm.</i>&mdash;It is in favour of the derivation
<i>&agrave; l'arme</i> that the Italian is <i>allarme</i>; some
dictionaries even have <i>dare all'arme</i>, with the apostrophe,
for to give alarm. It is against it that the German word
<i>L&auml;rm</i> is used precisely as the English <i>alarm</i>.
Your correspondent CH. thinks the French derivation suspiciously
ingenious: here I must differ; I think it suspiciously obvious. I
will give him a suggestion which I think really suspiciously
ingenious: in fact, had not the opportunity occurred for
illustrating ingenuity, I should not have ventured it. May it not
be that <i>alarme</i> and <i>allarme</i> is formed in the obvious
way, as <i>to arms</i>; while <i>alarum</i> and <i>L&auml;rm</i>
wholly unconnected with them? May it not sometimes happen that, by
coincidence, the same sounds and meanings go together in different
languages without community of origin? Is it not possible that
<i>larum</i> and <i>L&auml;rm</i> are imitations of the stroke and
subsequent resonance of a large bell? Denoting the continued sound
of <i>m</i> by <i>m-m-m</i>, I think that
<i>lrm-m-m-lrm-m-m-lrm-m-m</i> &amp;c., is as good an imitation of
a large bell at some distance as letters can make. And in the old
English use of the word, the alarum refers more often to a bell
than to any thing else.</p>
<p>The introduction of the military word into English can be
traced, as to time, with a certain probability. In 1579, Thomas
Digges published his <i>Arithmeticall Militare Treatise named
Stratioticos</i>, which he informs us is mainly the writing of his
father, Leonard Digges. At page 170. the father seems to finish
with "and so I mean to finishe this treatise:" while the son, as we
must suppose, adds p. 171. and what follows. In the father's part
the word <i>alarm</i> is not mentioned, that I can find. If it
occurred anywhere, it would be in describing the duties of the
<i>scout-master</i>; but here we have nothing but <i>warning</i>
and <i>surprise</i>, never <i>alarm</i>. But in the son's appendix,
the word <i>alarme</i> does occur twice in one page (173.). It also
occurs in the body of the <i>second</i> edition of the book, when
of course it is the son who inserts it. We may say then, that, in
all probability, the military technical term was introduced in the
third quarter of the sixteenth century. This, I suspect, is too
late to allow us to suppose that the vernacular force which
Shakspeare takes it to have, could have been gained for it by the
time he wrote.</p>
<p>The second edition was published in 1590; about this time the
spelling of the English language made a very rapid approach to its
present form. This is seen to a remarkable extent in the two
editions of the <i>Stratioticos</i>; in the first, the commanding
officer of a regiment is always <i>corronel</i>, in the second
<i>collonel</i>. But the most striking instance I now remember, is
the following. In the first edition of Robert Recorde's <i>Castle
of Knowledge</i> (1556) occurs the following tetrastich:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"If reasons reache transcende the skye,</p>
<p>Why shoulde it then to earthe be bounde?</p>
<p>The witte is wronged and leadde awrye,</p>
<p>If mynde be maried to the grounde."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the second edition (1596) the above is spelt as we should now
do it, except in having <i>skie</i> and <i>awrie</i>.</p>

<p><i>Clergy sold for Slaves</i> (Vol. ii., p. 51.),&mdash;MR.
SANSOM will find in the <i>Cromwellian Diary of Thomas Burton</i>,
iv. 255. 273. 301-305., ample material for an answer to his
question respecting the sale of any of the loyal party for slaves
during the rebellion.</p>
<p>There is no evidence of any <i>clergymen</i> having been sold as
slaves to Algiers or Barbadoes. Drs. Beale, Martin, and Sterne,
heads of colleges, were threatened with this outrage (see
<i>Querela Cantabrigiensis</i> appended to the <i>Mercurius
Rusticus</i> p. 184). In the life of Dr. John Barwick, one of the
authors of the <i>Querela</i> (in the Eng. transl. p. 42.), the
story is thus told:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The rebels at that time threatened some of their greatest men
and most learned heads (such as Dr William Beale, Dr. Edward
Martin, and Dr. Richard Sterne) transportation into the isles of
America, or even to the barbarian Turks: for these great men, and
several other very eminent divines, were kept close prisoners in a
ship on the Thames, under the hatches, almost killed with stench,
hunger, and watching; and treated by the senseless mariners with
more insolence than if they had been the vilest slaves, or had been
confined there for some infamous robbery or murder. Nay, one Rigby,
a scoundrel of the very dregs of the parliament rebels, did at that
time expose these venerable persons to sale, and <i>would actually
have sold them for slaves, if any one would have bought
them</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a note, it is added that Rigby moved twice in the Long
Parliament,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That those lords and gentlemen who were prisoners, should be
sold as slaves to Argiere, or sent to the new plantations in the
West Indies, because he had contracted with two merchants for that
purpose."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Col. Rigby, so justly denounced by Barwick, sat in the Long
Parliament for the borough of Wigan, and in the Parliarment of
1658-9 represented Lancashire. He was a native of Preston, was bred
to the law, and held a colonel's rank in the parliamentary army. He
was one of the committee of sequestrators for Lancashire, served at
the siege of Latham House, and in 1649 was created Baron of the
Exchequer, but was superseded by Cromwell.</p>
<p>Calamy, the historian and chaplain of the Nonconformists,
treated Walker's statement quoted by MR. SANSOM as a fiction, and
advised him to expunge the passage. See his <i>Church and
Dissenters compared as to Persecution</i>, 1719, pp. 40, 41.</p>
<p class="author">A.B.R.</p>
<p><i>North Side of Churchyards</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 55.
189).&mdash;One of your writers has recently endeavoured to explain
the popular dislike to burial on the north side of the church, by
reference to the place of the churchyard cross, the sunniness, and
the greater resort of the people to the south. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>{254}</span> These are
not only meagre reasons, but they are incorrect.</p>
<p>The doctrine of regions was coeval with the death of Our Lord.
The east was the realm of the oracles; the especial Throne of God.
The west was the domain of the people; the Galilee of all nations
was there. The south, the land of the mid-day, was sacred to things
heavenly and divine. The north was the devoted region of Satan and
his hosts; the lair of demons, and their haunt. In some of our
ancient churches, over against the font, and in the northern walls,
there was a devil's door.</p>
<p>It was thrown open at every baptism for the escape of the fiend,
and at all other seasons carefully closed. Hence came the old
dislike to sepulture at the north.</p>

<p><i>Sir John Perrot</i> (Vol. ii., p. 217.).&mdash;This Query
surprises me. Sir John Perrot was not governor of Ireland <i>in the
reign of Henry VIII.</i>, and your correspondent E.N.W. is mistaken
in his belief that Sir John was <i>beheaded</i> in the reign of
Elizabeth. He was convicted of treason 16th June, 1592, and died in
the Tower in September following. In the <i>British Plutarch</i>,
3rd edit., 1791, vol. i. p. 121., is <i>The Life of Sir John
Perrot</i>. The authorities given are Cox's <i>History of Ireland;
Life of Sir John Perrot</i>, 8vo., 1728; <i>Biographia

may add the following references:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Coins of Constantius II.</i>&mdash;The coins of this prince
are, from their titles being identical with those of his cousin,
very difficult to be distinguished. <i>My</i> only guide is the
portrait. Gallus died at twenty-nine; and we may suppose that his
coins would present a more youthful portrait than Constantius II.
The face of Constantius is long and thin, and is distinguished by
the royal diadem. The youthful head resembling Constantius the
Great with the laurel crown, <i>Rev</i>. Two military figures
standing, with spears and bucklers, between them two standards,

<p><i>California</i> (Vol. ii, p. 132.).&mdash;Your correspondent
E.N.W. will find earlier anticipations of "the golden harvest now
gathering in California," in vol. iii. of <i>Hakluyt's Voyages</i>,
p. 440-442, where an account is given of Sir F. Drake's taking
possession of Nova Albion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is no part of earth here to bee taken up, wherein there
is not speciall likelihood of gold or silver."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Callendar's <i>Voyages</i>, vol. i. p. 303., and other
collections containing Sir F. Drake's voyage to Magellanica, there
is the same notice. The earth of the country seemed to promise very
rich veins of gold and silver, there being hardly any digging
without throwing up some of the ores of them.</p>
<p class="author">T.J.</p>
<p><i>Bishops and their Precedence</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 9.
76.)&mdash;The precedence of bishops is regulated by the act of 31
Hen. VIII. c. 10., "for placing of the Lords." Bishops are, in
fact, temporal barons, and, as stated in Stephen's
<i>Blackstone</i>, vol. iii. pp. 5, 6., sit in the House of Peers
in right of succession to certain ancient baronies annexed, or
supposed to be annexed, to their episcopal lands; and as they have
in addition high spiritual rank, it is but right they should have
place before those who, in temporal rank only, are equal to them.
This is, in effect, the meaning of the reason given by Coke in part
iii. of the Institutes, p. 361. ed. 1670, where, after noticing the
precedence amongst the bishops themselves, namely, 1. The Bishop of
London, 2. The Bishop of Durham, 3. The Bishop of Winchester, he
observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But the other bishops have place above all the barons of the
realm, because they hold their bishopricks of the king per
baroniam; but they give place to viscounts, earls, marquesses, and
dukes."</p>

throw some light upon the family of Dr. Bever.</p>

<p><i>Eikon Basilike</i> (Vol. ii., p. 134.).&mdash;I would suggest
to A.C. that the circumstance of his copy of this work bearing on
its cover "C.R.," surmounted by a crown, may not be indicative of
its having been in the possession of royalty. It may have been,
perhaps, not unusual to occasionally so distinguish words of this
description published in or about that year (1660). I have a small
volume entitled&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

Murder of his royal father of Happy Memory, and continued to this
present year, 1660, by a person of quality. Printed for <i>James

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>
<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>
<p>Collections of Wills have always been regarded, and very justly
so, as among the most valuable materials which exist for
illustrating the social condition of the people at the period to
which they belong. Executed, as they must be, at moments the most
solemn displaying, as we cannot but believe they do, the real
feelings which actuate the testators; and having for their object
the distribution of existing property, and that of every possible
variety of description, it is obvious that they alike call for
investigation, and are calculated to repay any labour that may be
bestowed upon them. It is therefore, perhaps, somewhat matter of
surprise that the Camden Society should not hitherto have printed
any of this interesting class of documents; and that only in the
twelfth year of its existence it should have given to its members
the very interesting volume of <i>Wills and Inventories from the
Registers of the Commissary of Bury St. Edmunds and the Archdeacon
of Sudbury</i>, which has been edited for the Society by Mr. Tymms,
the active and intelligent Treasurer and Secretary of the Bury and
West Suffolk Arch&aelig;ological Institute. The selection contains
upwards of fifty Wills, dated between 1370 and 1649, and the
documents are illustrated by a number of brief but very instructive
notes; and as the volume is rendered more useful by a series of
very complete indices, we have no doubt it will be as satisfactory
to the members as it is creditable to its editor. Mr. Tymms
acknowledges his obligations to Mr. Way and Mr. J. Gough Nicols: we
are sure the Camden Society would be under still greater
obligations to those gentlemen if they could be persuaded to
undertake the production of the series of Lambeth Wills which was
to have been edited by the late Mr. Stapleton, with Mr. Way's
assistance.</p>
<p>When the proprietors of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> at the
commencement of the present year announced their projected
improvements in that periodical, we expressed our confidence that
they would really and earnestly put forth fresh claims to the
favour of the public. Our anticipations have been fully realised.
Each succeeding number has shown increased energy and talent in the
"discovery and establishment of historical truth in all its
branches," and that the conductors of this valuable periodical, the
only "Historical Review" in the country, continue to pursue these
great objects faithfully and honestly, as in times past, but more
diligently and more undividedly. No student of English history can
now dispense with, no library which places historical works upon
its shelves can now be complete without <i>The Gentleman's Magazine
and Historical Review</i>.</p>

reference to the expediency of promoting a union between the
Association and the Institute. The Committee desire to give this
public notice, that they are ready, as they have always been, to
admit members of the Association desirous of joining the Institute.
They have determined accordingly, that, in order to offer
reasonable encouragement to the members of the Association, they
shall henceforth be eligible without the payment of the customary
entrance fee, on the intimation of their wish to the Committee to
be proposed for election. Life-members of the Association shall be
eligible as life-members on payment of half the usual composition.

privilege of acquiring the previous publications of the Institute

<p>"These heads" (Ceres, Flora, and Pomona) are of a high order of
art, and Mr. De la Motte, by means of the Talbotype, has so
successfully reduced them that the engravings are perfect

<p>"Our authors have very advantageously brought to their task a

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
